# Resume for Bart Koelman (Leiden area, The Netherlands)

[Clean](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) C# code, that's what pleases me. For over ten years, design principles like [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)), [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) and [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) have been buzzing through my mind on a daily basis while (re)writing code. Mostly ASP.NET (MVC) enterprise-level internal applications, as well as the high-volume www.t-mobile.nl website.

Some developers work for the money, others to "make the customer happy". I see that differently. Want to control my own success.
Have a team vision, form concrete goals. Getting there in small steps. That's what makes me run faster!

Please stop reading if this sounds too idealistic for you.

*"(...) Maar soms heb je een Bart Koelman nodig: iemand die de echt complexe software problemen kan vertalen in simpele oplossingen. Iemand die verder kijkt dan vandaag en de discussie durft aan te gaan. En iemand die met programmeertalen niet alleen kan lezen en schrijven, maar ook een niveau van elegantie en inzicht bereikt dat maar voor een kleine minderheid in het vakgebied is weggelegd."* -- 2011, W. van Parera, Software Architect at T-Mobile

In my spare time, I like contributing to the open-source [Microsoft Roslyn project](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) (C# and VB.NET compilers). Helping to bring the [languages](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20author%3Abkoelman) and [toolsets](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20author%3Abkoelman) to a higher level. While doing that, I'm proudly drinking from my [Cup\<T\>](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2015/07/02/thank-you-for-your-contributions/), personally engraved by the Roslyn team!

*"Bart has been a really awesome contributor to Roslyn analysis and compiler platform open-source projects. He writes clean code, understands all the nuances of software development very well and is extremely passionate about his work. I am one of the primary owners of the roslyn based analyzers project at Microsoft (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers) and Bart has been by far the most involved and consistent community contributor to the repo - we almost feel like he is part of our team! I would like again thank Bart for his numerous contributions to the Roslyn projects and hope there are many more to come in the future!"* -- 2016, M. Vasani, SDE at Microsoft
