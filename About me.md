In my spare time, I like to dance salsa, bachata and my newest favorite: [Kizomba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZALjhhZEYs). This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0fWu07eLLs) impressed me so much that I ordered the book [Nooit Af](https://www.managementboek.nl/boek/9789023251163/nooit-af-martijn-aslander) the next day. Reading it inspired me to start learning Spanish using [Duolingo](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duolingo). Besides that, I've had a subscription on the printed magazine [c't](http://www.ct.nl/) since many years.

Asking people to characterize me, they say:

A quote that I like:
*"Everyone knew it was impossible, until someone came along that didn't know."*
