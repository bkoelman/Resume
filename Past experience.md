| **Role** | Scrum Developer |
| **Project** | National  Skills Portal for Dutch Teachers |
| **Scenario** | The website https://www.registerleraar.nl/ enables Dutch teachers to register the schools they are associated with. Due to stricter laws, all Dutch teachers were now required to be listed, including the grades that they are qualified for. This required a redesign of this website, including synchronization with [BRP](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basisregistratie_Personen) and [DUO](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dienst_Uitvoering_Onderwijs) and more advanced search capabilities.

### Experience at [T-Mobile Netherlands](https://www.t-mobile.nl/) as consultant of [T-Systems Nederland](https://www.t-systems.com/nl/nl)

| **Role** | [SAFe Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Agile_Framework) Developer |
| **Project** | Data Pooling for Municipalities |
| **Scenario** | Corporate telecom customers want to buy their data at a large scale and then divide over their employees. This required changes in the mobile network, as well as in billing and portal systems. Being a member of a multidisciplinary scrum team, we designed, implemented and tested the required changes to enable this. The public portal application enables corporate telecom managers to configure data limits and sms notifications per subscriber, or in batch through import/export. |
|     |     |
| **Period** | 2016-03 |
| **Role** | [SAFe Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Agile_Framework) Developer |
| **Project** | Invoice notifications for business customers |
| **Scenario** | Implemented sending notifications per email/sms to business customers for their next monthly invoice. Affected changes in processing of billing files, a new webservice and multi-threaded atomic transactional job processing using a database queue. |
|     |     |
| **Period** | 2016-01 |
| **Role** | Developer |
| **Project** | iDEAL payments via BNP Paribas |
| **Scenario** | Extension of the existing Ogone online payment platform, so that intermediary payment providers can be bypassed ([BNP Paribas](http://www.bnpparibas.nl/en/) in this case) to reduce monetary transaction costs. |
|     |     |
| **Period** | 2015-12 |
| **Role** | Developer |
| **Project** | VoIP network settings |
| **Scenario** | Mobile network configuration changes are typically enqueued by technical engineers or customer care agents. In this project, the existing application was extended to support VoIP settings and show colored diff-view (add/remove/modify) between the current and proposed configurations. |
|     |     |
| **Period** | 2015-04 |
| **Role** | Developer |
| **Project** | Network authentication in REST API |
| **Scenario** | Extended the T-Mobile REST API, which is used by mobile apps, to support single sign-on when the source IP address is known to be on the T-Mobile network. |
|     |     |
| **Period** | 2015-02 |
| **Role** | Developer |
| **Project** | Knowledge base integration |
| **Scenario** | Added search facility on the [www.t-mobile.nl](https://www.t-mobile.nl/zoeken?q=prepaid&section=Particulier) website, which used a SOAP-based search into an external 3rd-party system; then presents the search results in matching layout. |
|     |     |
| **Period** | 2014-08 |
| **Role** | Developer |
| **Project** | Single Sign-on using Oracle RightNow Pass-Through Authentication |
| **Scenario** | The T-Mobile website integrates Oracle RightNow (provided by third party) for customer questions, FAQ, usage guides etc. The existing custom-built single sign-on mechanism needed to be replaced by Oracleâ€™s built-in Pass-Through authentication to reduce maintenance costs. PTA uses an AES-256 encrypted payload to transfer customer details over HTTPS and provides features to synchronize sessions and login/logout. This involved reverse-engineering the current implementation and design and build a new solution using PTA. Coordination with technical lead from third party to discuss how to deal with encodings, padding, URL callbacks etc. |
|     |     |
| **Period** | 2014-06 - 2014-08 |
| **Role** | Developer |
| **Project** | National Data Passes & Calling Credits |
| **Scenario** | When the data bundle of a T-Mobile customer depletes halfway, it must be possible to buy a pass that resets to full up- and download speed until the next bill cycle starts. Also it must be possible by customer care agents to compensate customers that experienced outages by giving them such passes for free (instead of money). This required updates to various systems, including multiple applications on the T-Mobile website, REST API (used by the official T-Mobile App on Android and iOS) and internal web services. My responsibilities were to review designs, quote, implement and support testers. |
|     |     |
| **Period** | 2014-04 |
| **Role** | Scrum Developer |
| **Project** | Redesign Usage Status |
| **Scenario** | Because data usage is getting more and more important over phone calls, the existing Call Status application on the T-Mobile website was redesigned to emphasize data usage. In addition to this, features were added to make upsell easier. As a developer in a scrum team, I worked with visual designers, testers, other developers and scrum master. |
|     |     |
| **Period** | 2014-02 - 2014-03 |
| **Role** | Scrum Developer |
| **Project** | Landlord |
| **Scenario** | Individuals and organizations that host a mobile network transceiver on their building for T-Mobile are compensated with a monthly fee. A new section on the T-Mobile website had to be created that enables these landlords to login, review their invoice history, update contact details and provide an inbox where they can correspond with T-Mobile employees to ask questions. We used SOAP-based integration with SAP XI and automated emails. |
|     |     |
| **Period** | 2013-10 |
| **Role** | Developer |
| **Project** | Convert all business contracts to T-Mobile Helder rateplan |
| **Scenario** | After the success of rateplan "Stel Samen" (residential subscribers can freely choose how many megabytes, sms-es and calling credits they want in their rateplan by using sliders which work independent of each other), a similar rateplan was introduced for business customers. Business contracts are usually complex in that they consist of multiple rateplans with varying add-ons. The goal of this Scrum was to design a tool that customer care agents could use to advise existing customers how to switch to a similar Helder rateplan. Work involved converting a large excel-sheet into a database-driven tool with Ajax capabilities for hierarchical filtering. |
|     |     |
| **Period** | 2013-05 - 2013-09 |
| **Role** | Developer |
| **Project** | 4G Coverage |
| **Scenario** | For the introduction of 4G network, various systems needed to be adapted, such as the coverage map, coverage complaint entry and integration with third parties such as [NetworkRadar](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/netwerkradar/id376641329?mt=8). I extended the coverage map on dekking.t-mobile.nl to support display of 4G coverage, 4G sites and hubs, network maintenance reporting, integration with www.t-mobile.nl and m.t-mobile.nl and various internal subsystems within the T-Mobile domain. |
|     |     |
| **Period** | 2013-01 - 2013-04 |
| **Role** | Scrum Developer |
| **Project** | Cross & Upsell Tool on www.t-mobile.nl |
| **Scenario** | Customers on the T-Mobile website must be able to queue various changes to their rate  plan and associated add-ons in a shopping basket and confirm all changes at the end on an overview page that shows old and new situation including prices, discounts etc. As a developer in the scrum team, I worked on design and implementation of a change tracking system that complies with business rules such as: "When changing to rateplan X, add-on Y is no longer possible and at least one add-on from mutually exclusive group Z must be selected." |
|     |     |
| **Period** | 2012-10 |
| **Role** | Developer |
| **Project** | Encrypted configuration |
| **Scenario** | The security department within T-Mobile demands that all configuration data on servers, such as database connection strings, cryptographic keys, server names and email addresses are stored encrypted. Operational department requires tooling to easily decrypt-change-encrypt such files to prevent considerable extra work. I Implemented automated decryption of configuration settings at runtime and provided operators with a tool on which they can drag-and-drop configuration files that can then be edited and are automatically re-encrypted when changes have been made. In addition, this tool was used for the one-time encryption of all existing settings. |

### Experience at [eVision Industry Software](https://www.evision-software.com/) as consultant of [Aviva Solutions](http://avivasolutions.nl/)

| **Role** | Scrum Developer |
| **Project** | Permit Vision |
| **Scenario** | eVision develops the product [Permit Vision](https://www.evision-software.com/blog/project/issow-integrated-safe-system-of-work/), which is used to manage the workflow of maintenance activities (including risk assessment) at an oil rig, conforming to ISO standards NEN/ISO 17776, NOGEPA and Deltalinqs. I worked in multiple Scrum sprints on extending the Permit Vision product. The first sprints focusing on customizations for BG Group. Later I joined the product development team. |

### Experience at [T-Mobile Netherlands](https://www.t-mobile.nl/) as consultant of [Ordina](https://www.ordina.nl/)

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
| **Period** | 2011-04 - 2011-06 |
| **Role** | Developer |
| **Project** | Upgrade of Customer Mutations Service |
| **Scenario** | Replacement of (part of) one of the most critical and oldest web services within the Web Portals domain. It was an asmx-based web service that used XML blobs. The new solution has been realized using WCF according to the Scheme Based Contract First approach. The interface WSDL was provided by the TIBCO Business Works (middleware) team. For the implementation I used ThinkTecture's [WSCF.blue](https://wscfblue.codeplex.com/). During this process I submitted several bug fixes to the CodePlex project, which resulted in a new public release. |
|     |     |
| **Period** | 2011-04 - 2011-05 |
| **Role** | Lead Developer |
| **Project** | Coverage map T-Mobile |
| **Scenario** | The coverage map application of T-Mobile (based on Google Maps), which was in use by both customers and internal support engineers, had to be extended with new features based on user demand. Besides developing core parts of the solution I was the primary responsible and contact person for the development activities and planning. My work included providing guidance to a medior UI-developer. |
|     |     |
| **Period** | 2010-08 - 2010-09 |
| **Role** | Lead Developer |
| **Project** | Automated handset settings |
| **Scenario** | On the website of T-Mobile, a user can select his/her brand and type of handset from a dropdown list, after which the system sends an sms with technical phone configuration settings for sms/mms/email-gateway, Bluetooth etc. In the new situation, the application retrieves in real-time from the GSM network in what brand/type of handset the usersâ€™ SIM card is currently active. Non-logged-in users must enter their phone number first. There were variations of this mechanism required for dealers and customer service representatives. My work involved to elaborate designs in collaboration with business analyst and tester. In addition, inventory, scheduling, work allocation and realization of this project with commitment of me and two medior developers. I myself have built complex components, such as multilayer caching to reduce load on backend systems, single sign-on mechanisms, etc. |
|     |     |
| **Period** | 2010-03 - 2010-04 |
| **Role** | Web Developer |
| **Project** | Paying invoices using "Via Mijn Bank" (Digital Payments) |
| **Scenario** | In this large multi-system project, it had to become possible for customers to see their T-Mobile invoices and pay them from within their banking portals (telebanking). Due to privacy laws, these invoices could not be stored in the banking systems. To make viewing of invoices possible, a trusted connection between banking systems and the www.t-mobile.nl website through an intermediate party (Billing Service Provider) had to be setup. My tasks involved the design and implementation of cryptographic functions with RSA and DSA public / private key pairs, supported by a security architect. I aligned this design with the engineers at the Billing Service Provider and implemented some diagnostic tooling. Invoices on www.t-mobile.nl are in turn downloaded from a system from Germany, which takes several seconds. To prevent thread starvation on our web servers, I used asynchronous I/O calls, combined with a custom Ajax solution (polling). Part of my work involved delegation/management of a developer in St. Petersburg, who was adapting the existing registration wizards elsewhere on the website. The complete solution was put commercially live in multiple phases. Today (October 2010) this service is being used by tens of thousands of customers. |

| **Period** | 2009-09 - 2009-10 |
| **Role** | Lead Web Developer |
| **Project** | Login password hashing & Single Sign-On |
| **Scenario** | As a result of tighter security requirements, it was no longer permitted to store customer account passwords for the www.t-mobile.nl website in the database as plain text. In the new scenario, the system had be changed to use password hashes with salts, including automatically expiring passwords that would be sent by sms in case a user forgot his/her password. After logging in with this secondary password, the user was forced to change his/her primary password. Existing single sign-on entry points used to lookup user passwords in the database (and then enter the regular authentication flow), which was no longer possible in the new scenario. This meant redefining about 15 existing single sign-on solutions. My role involved technical design of the solution and guiding three medior application developers. Also building a new login- and single sign-on API, that was consumed by application developers in various scenarios. The framework behind this API provided data access, password hashing and generation, ticket encryption including an impersonation chain. Example API calls are Login, RequestPasswordChange, ChangePassword etc. |
|     |     |
| **Period** | 2009-07 - 2009-08 |
| **Role** | Web Developer |
| **Project** | Download Server |
| **Scenario** | Due to the increasing demand for online publishing of large binaries for dealers, a separate web server was needed to offload existing web servers. An essential requirement was that only logged in dealers were allowed to download these binaries. My activities concerned technical design and implementation of multiple ASP.NET handlers in a redirect chain, which provided login and authorization on one of the regular web servers in the farm. The single sign-on ticket was protected with a short expiration to prevent access to unauthorized users. By using [ISAPI_Rewrite](http://www.helicontech.com/isapi_rewrite/), download links in existing content did not have to be changed to point to the download server, which allowed for a zero-effort migration. |
|     |     |
| **Period** | 2008-07 - 2008-12 |
| **Role** | Developer |
| **Project** | Low-level link to Telecommunications network for sending smses |
| **Scenario** | In the mobile telecommunications network, a number of systems were being phased out and alternatives introduced. From a cost perspective it was decided that the public website needed a direct link to a new SMSC, using the proprietary low-level Nokia CIMD protocol. This protocol stems from the time that the Internet did not exist and was designed for use on terminal connections. It therefore contains a range of facilities that today's IP and TCP layers handle, which makes them irrelevant to web developers. For instance, binary encoding of packets, checksums, character sets, packet numbering, retransmissions, automatic recovery of colliding packets in both directions, etc. Since no appropriate third party library for CIMD was available, I have implemented all the low-level communication by myself. In other words, interpretation of the [Nokia CIMD specification](http://www.advox.se/download/protocols/Cimd_SC80.pdf) (75 pages with references to two other documents of similar size) and alignment of ambiguities with the mobile network team. Design, implementation and technical test of the .NET based CIMD protocol implementation. CIMD is not a client/server protocol, which means that two communication parties can simultaneously initiate actions, for which a response is expected. In effect, this meant implementing a server application that continuously kept its connection open, automatically reconnecting as soon as keep-alive packets were not acknowledged in time. The known reliability requirements come into play here, such as not leaking resources like memory, threads and connections, which is normally handled by IIS and the operating system. In addition, my work involved construction of a proxy server for system testers that enabled them to record-and-playback test scripts and a tool to create/edit CIMD packets and conversations from a GUI. |

| **Period** | 2008-01 - 2008-06 |
| **Role** | Lead Web Developer |
| **Project** | Ajax based dashboard on landing page of public website |
| **Scenario** | The business wanted the public website to contain a dashboard that is displayed after login. Depending on the type of user, different information blocks had to be shown. For example, the call and sms credit, recent invoices, bonus points, customer contact details, etc. Because all this data was stored in various slow backends (some calls took up to 90 seconds), a custom Ajax solution was needed. This allows a user to login and immediately use the website, while in the background the dashboard blocks are being filled with information. Because of high load on the landing page and the six blocks of information, the out-of-the-box Microsoft ASP.NET Ajax solution did not suffice and therefore I have written a compact and highly efficient custom Ajax solution. I designed, implemented and load-tested an advanced caching, scripting and background retrieval framework, which enabled loading content into the dashboard blocks. In addition, I guided three developers who were responsible for building the block-specific business logic and UI. To show their appreciation, the business team gave us a cake which contained a picture of the new dashboard. In the following months, other developers added new information blocks and reused the API that was introduced by me. |
|     |     |
| **Period** | 2007-01 - 2007-03 |
| **Role** | Developer |
| **Project** | Background Services Platform |
| **Scenario** | The processing of background tasks on the public website took such an extent that it led to decreasing performance of the entire website. To remedy this, the team architect and me designed and implemented an infrastructure to process background tasks via a database queue on separate servers. I was responsible for development and expansion of the basic solution, which allowed tasks to be run as either Windows Service or as a scheduled task in a configurable number of threads inside their own AppDomain. The solution included detection of deployments by using shadow copying of assemblies. This enabled deployment of new versions without the need to stop running Windows services by an administrator. Additionally, I built a framework for handling tasks from the queue and implemented an API for adding new jobs. I also migrated existing code to use the new architecture. Delegating long running tasks from the public web servers to dedicated background servers reduced the load on the web servers, which enabled them to better handle load. The increased scalability offered new possibilities for future developments. In the subsequent years this infrastructure was frequently used. |
